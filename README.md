# Friday Night Funkin': Vs Fear (Test Build)

## Installation:
Follow a Friday Night Funkin' source code compilation tutorial, after this you will need to install LuaJIT.

You can do this with: `haxelib install linc_luajit` on a Command prompt/PowerShell

...Or if you don't want your mod to be able to run .lua scripts, delete the "LUA_ALLOWED" line on Project.xml
